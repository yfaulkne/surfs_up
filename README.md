## Purpose
##### The purpose of this project was to collect data for a potential investment in a surf shop in Oahu, Hawaii.
##### The business concept is a combination surf and ice cream shop and the potenetial investor wanted to know weather and precipitation data throughout the year on the island. For the challenge, the data was parsed from a SQLite file and analyzed for the months of June and December.

## Results
##### June Results
* June had 1700 counts of data with an average temperature of 75 degrees Farenheit. 
* The minimum temperature was 65 degrees and the maximum was 85 degrees.
##### December Results
* December had just over 1500 counts of data with an average temperature of 71 degrees Farenheit. 
* The minimum temperature was 56 dgrees and the maximum was 83 degrees.

## Summary
##### In order to provide a more end-user friendly statitsics analysis, I created histograms for both the June and Decmeber Results. Also, using numpy, I calculated the mode of both months for further clarification. 
* The mode for June temperatures was 76.
* The mode for December temperatures was 71.

##### The reuslts showed that weather in Oahu is fairly stable year round with temperatures ranging from roughly 56 to 85 degrees Farenheit from June to December.
##### I would recommend opening the surf shop in Oahu as this seems like a great location with moderate temperatures great for surfing and ice cream.
